# Incentive sync 2019-09-10
## Agenda ##
- Devcon
    - A: Vojtech on Holiday now, Marcelo and Rinke will drive that we at least have the requirements from the incentives track
- [#1739](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/issues/1739) ([#1548](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/issues/1548) vs [#1599](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/issues/1599))
    - A: last part of 1739 seems to be too difficult, otherwise good idea
- [#1725](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1725) status
    - A: review and merge
- [#1729](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1729) feedback
    - A: Fabio will have a look
- [#1733](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1733) status
    - A: will be merged
- chequebook / SWAP naming
    - A: Make a PR with the rename. In general: not against.
- [renaming/refactor](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1720#discussion_r320158552): . Perhaps overlap with work of Ralph (peer refactor) and also related to [discussion](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1718#discussion_r320803573)
    - A: issuer/beneficiary is not a naming we should use out of the context of cheques.
- [refactor tests](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/pull/1718#discussion_r321138777): contracts/swap does not have any tests; all functionality is tested in swap_test.go. We can refactor the test by creating tests in contracts/swap, so we can depend on the functionality of contracts/swap in swap (and potentially other future packages). 
    - A: It is a good idea if contracts/swap have their own tests. Must be self-contained due to circular dependencies
- `Peer.Send` [question](https://beehive.ethswarm.org/swarm/pl/onmtdoxprjbo5qrfbkrntrhwjr)
    - A: for now, checking for `err` is good enough here
