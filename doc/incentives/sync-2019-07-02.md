Board: https://github.com/orgs/ethersphere/projects/9

## Present:
Rinke, Fabio, Vojtech, Marcelo, Diego, Ralph, Viktor

## Introduction

## Progress report by each team member
Fabio:
- Implement signing of cheque
- Rabit hole, cleaning up legacy code (esp in codebase/services/swap)
- Not clear what should be thrown away and what should be kept
- Spoke with Victor, which cleared up
- Continues with signing of cheque message and integrating protocol

Marcelo:
- Focused on threshold task [#1440](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/issues/1440), blocked - waiting for open research questions
- Began looking into and working on issue [#1447](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/issues/1447) - command line tool to check balance
- Questions for Fabio â†’ later

Rinke
- Finished issues [#10](https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle/issues/10) & [#32](https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle/issues/32) Mostly cleaning code, refactoring.
- Working on issue [#30](https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle/issues/30) making tests better, inspired by open zeppelin
- Split repository into stable & experimental - Simple swap will be in master, everything else in a different branch for now.

Diego
- Starting working on [SWIP for L2 payments draft.](https://hackmd.io/2KT41vqwQlW1rw7Ojmyzzw)

Vojtech
- Participated in the IPFS camp => great progress at IPFS, filecoin is unclear (maybe test net by the end of year, needs integration with blockchain)
- Released [article](https://www.rifos.org/blog/rif-storage-the-first-chunks/) with Rinke
- Unlikely that Vojtech will do coding this week
- Requested for senior golang developer to join the team

Ralph
- Currently reviewing PRs from Rinke
- At end of week he can commit more time

## Questions
### Top-up
1) handling keys
    - private key in memory as a first implementation, 
    - cleff(?) is more advanced (external signer) solution => can be used later.
2) strategy on topping up
    - On deployment: top-up checkbook with a balance


## Needs
## Next steps
