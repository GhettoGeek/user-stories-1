**Participants**:
Rinke Hendriksen
Fabio Barone
Tim Bansemer
Aron Fischer
Diego Masini
Marcelo Ortelli
Viktor Tron
Vojtech Simetka - developer - 

## Introduction by Fabio:##
Reference to the Incentive meeting during the last Swarm summit - works from Amerika Timezone
Goal 1: Get clarity on what is the Swarm incentive workgroup about

MVP Goal IOV Definition / Acceptance Criteria

## Introduction of all participants:##

**Fabio**:
Developer (20+ years), 2 years in the swarm team, interested in incentives for about a year, had to address stability first (synching/config/simulation front-end), working from South America (Colombia)

**Vojtech**:
Developer (5+ years), mostly focussed on low-level C++, started to work with IOV-labs 2 months ago, the goal to bring decentralized storage to RSK, Swarm the best solution, all around the world, tries to stay in Europe

**Marcelo**:
Uruguay (South America), Python background, works with Vojtech over a month, gitter: mortelli

**Diego**:
Part of IOV labs, software developer 15 years, looked into Swarm a year ago, based in Argentina, mostly in Argentina

**Aron**:
Worked with Victor on the original orange papers at the start of Swarm (research), background in Mathematics, have been thinking about Swarm incentives for 4+ years

**Viktor**:
Team lead for Swarm team, in the foundation since the beginning, big interest in incentives (together with Aron). 
2 scopes for incentives: 
	1) 
	2)

**Rinke**:
Background in Economy (BSc.), a software developer for 2 years, mostly smart-contracts (Solidity), proficient in other languages as well, currently getting up to speed with Golang.

**Tim Bansemer**:
Joined Swarm team 3 months ago for  organisational  strategic questions, for this meeting: questions with regards to scope, 

## Epic for incentivization ##
github.com/ethersphere/user-stories/issues/14

Rationale (Viktor): We are talking about a p2p system where emergent network behavior is dependent on the decisions of users. Such a system is dependent on the extent to which we succeed in keeping such nodes alive. Therefore: we need a system which is economically sustainable in the long run. Solution for free-riders problem/tragedy of the commons. Economic incentive system should reward behavior that is in line with the desired operation of the network as a whole. Summarized by paper: https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/ethersphere/orange-papers/1
Follow-up paper: https://www.overleaf.com/project/59c298da5b3a6e3b7ec80d56 (partly implemented: https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle/tree/master/contracts). Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZbhjnhP5g4, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cgyhsjsfbg. This goes into detail on how nodes are meant to interact in the context of incentives. Currently: the code measures the number of bytes exchanged with nodes and accounts with a fictional price for this => nothing happens afterward. 
One of the major things to find out for now: how is price discovered (for MVP: fixed?), 

**Requirements Vojtech**:
Idea is to deliver an incentivized decentralized storage solution by the end of the year (RIF whitepaper) => SWAP fulfills most of the requirements, no need to have insurance working. Vojtech will write this user story (through pull request). 

**PSS (About bandwidth incentivization): can be excluded from MVP.**

There exist an earlier project board: https://github.com/orgs/ethersphere/projects/2

**What needs to be done**:
* Smart-contract implementation
* Bridges into the go code (generate go-bindings, etc)
* More?

**Diego/Marcelo tasks**:
Diego is a researcher (works also on Raiden fork), could work on simulations, 

Aron: doubts whether there is an explicit need for disconnecting, instead not serving data anymore. Blocking more appropriate name (Viktor). 

Next steps: Be clear on the scope (Vojtech writes MVP documents: context, expected delivery, what is not part of it), roadmap (end of next week).
