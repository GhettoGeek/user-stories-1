- Found a way to run simulations in process which means we can run the simulated backend

## Marcelo
- Main PR is pretty much done but we need 2 reviews
- Reviewed Fabio's test, but would like an explanation from someone from core why this was removed
- Began to review the SWIP documents

## Vojtech
- SWIPs
- [PayToStore](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9N70zwrwVPaOWspmmUD7tDN4cbkc8zb5_ABGCs9eFQ/edit?usp=sharing) - centralised persistent storage 
- [Worked on marketing route](https://trello.com/b/eEmKlLSJ/marketing-for-rif-storage-and-comms) to figure out what to show/tell before and @ devcon

## Diego

## Communication
- Non optimal communication within the team demonstrated by a PR that resolves to remove all the TODO's from the code.
- Prehaps this is partially caused by the time differences
- Create daily text standup channel, suggested questions:
    1. What I was working on today?
    2. What is my plan tomorrow?
    3. What do I need help with, what is blocking me.

## PR discussion
- Who merges?
    - Until recently it was only Viktor and nonsense
    - Recently suggested (by Viktor) that the PR author merges
- In our case we need at leat 2 reviews - on from our time, one from core and the PR owner merges
